# Finals

## Inheritence! Inheritence! Inheritence!
## Take inspiration from midterm
## Read every single line (especially the comments) of every single .java file on bruinlearn, that's all the material you need. 

## A non-exhaustive list of important topics:
- **Please note I DO NOT have the access to final exam, I haven't seen it, all the following topics are my guess/understanding of important topics after a conversion with Micheal. Please make sure to read other things apart from the following, if you don't then this list is useless**

1. type conversions
2. array/object memory references -- see midterm last question and array question.
3. static method/fields versus instance method/fields; 
    - `StaticBlock.java`
    - `StaticOrder.java`
4. compile-time, run-time errors associated with polymorphic conversions; 
    - `PolymorphicConversions.java`
5. private methods are not inherited/overridden; 
    - `PrivateInherit.java`
6. default constructors
    - `DefaultConstructor.java`
8. compile-time errors when interfaces are not implemented correctly but are declared to be; 
 - `Interfaces.java`
 - `AbstractClass.java`
9. compile-time errors associated with checked exceptions
    - If a checked exception is not handled, it causes a compile-time error
    - order of exception handling
10. learn to know when there will be a compile-time error vs runtime-error
11. final keyword 
12. GUIs? 
13. private constructor

## Differences
1. Static methods vs instance methods
2. Abstract class vs Interface
3. Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
4. Exceptions vs RunTime Exceptions
5. Inner vs Outer Classes
